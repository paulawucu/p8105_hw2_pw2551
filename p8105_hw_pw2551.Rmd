## Problem 1
Read and clean the Mr.Trash Wheel dataset:
```{r}
# skip = 1, skip the graph
wheels_df = 
  read_excel("./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", range = "Mr. Trash Wheel!A2:N408") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(!(is.na(dumpster))) %>% # filter out rows that don't have dumpster-specific data
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, 0)) # round sports_balls to nearest integer
wheels_df
```
